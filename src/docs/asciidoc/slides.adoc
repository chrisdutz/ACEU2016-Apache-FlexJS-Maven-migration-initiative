== Agenda

[%step]
* Developing FlexJS in 2015
* Why migrate to Maven
* Migration strategy
* Developing FlexJS in 2016
* `flexjs-maven-plugin`
* Ongoing migrations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* why maven: Why migrate at all and why migrate to Maven and not Gradle
--

== Developing FlexJS in 2015

* Building with Ant only
* Building FlexJS required
** Cloning 2 GIT repositories
** Manually installing multiple tools
** Setting several environment variables (x > 6)
** Requires a strict directory structure of all projects

-> Only a hand full of developers working on FlexJS

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* no validation of settings: failures during the build with little help in finding out what's wrong
* directory structure: Ant scripts reference other projects based on relative paths
--

== Developing FlexJS in 2015

* Problems with the build
** Relies on direct downloads
** Dependencies not verified
** Build scripts quite hard to understand
** Circular dependencies
* CI feedback takes several hours

-> Frustrates people working on FlexJS

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* downloads: url changes, site outages, ...
* verification: file validated during download, but not when using previously downloaded jar -> need to delete all dependencies quite often
* circular dependencies: flex-sdk and flexjs-framework needed for tests of compiler, compiler needed to compile framework
* ci-feedback: External Jenkins, slow, doesn't build examples (No cross-compiler tests in the CI)
--

== Why migrate to Maven?

* WHY MIGRATE to Maven?
** Simplify the project
** Simplify the build process
** Make the build process more robust
** Get more people involved

== Why migrate to Maven?

* Why migrate TO MAVEN?
** Maven makes it hard to be sloppy
** Helps volunteers to get started
** Repo-System makes the build robust

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* hard to be sloppy: Gradle allows the same sloppiness as Ant,
** open-source requires volunteers,
** volunteers aren't all build specialists,
** we can't force volunteers not to be sloppy
** (but makes it harder for inexperienced volunteers to contribute to the build)
* getting started: default build makes it easy to get started
--

== Migration strategy

* Update the directory structure
* Find cycles in the build
* Refactor to eliminate cycles
** Extract code-generators into custom maven plugins
** Extract dependencies of code-generators into modules
** Refactor tests not to rely on cycles
** Split up into 3 repositories
* Get third party libraries mavenized

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* build-helpers: code generators, code manipulators
* 3 repos:
** compiler, typedefs, framework
*** In general typedefs and framework could be merged, but should be released separately
** Compiler contained code compiled by compiler (now in typedefs repo)
* 3rd party libs: Became committer of JBurg, did Maven release of JBurg
* 3rd party libs: Integrated the Apache Flex Maven Converter for Flex SDK, Flash, Air and Font-Kit dependencies

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Started writing documentation
* Created a Maven training video
--

== Developing FlexJS in 2016

* Set one environment variable
* Checkout 3 repositories
* Run the following on each of them
----
    mvn -s settings-template.xml clean install
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
environment-variable: Optional, only needed for running tests
build: settings-template only needed till we release the converter.

== Developing FlexJS in 2016

* CI feedback in about 30 minutes

== Developing FlexJS in 2016

* Automatic Site generation

== Developing FlexJS in 2016

* Static code analysis using SonarQube

[NOTE.speaker]
--
ci-feedback: CI Jobs build everything including distribution and examples
multi-branch: Jenkins automatically builds `develop` as well as `feature-autobuild/*` branches
sonar-qube: Currently still requiring external Sonar Qube until ASF updated to new version
--

== `flexjs-maven-plugin`


== Ongoing migrations

* Website generated with `maven-site-plugin`
* Automatic download of Flashplayer-Debugger in the converter (requires implementing code to unpack dmg files)
* Release the flex-sdk-converter
* Extend the flexjs-maven-plugin to support unit-testing
