= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: Asciidoc to reveal.js Example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to reveal.js slides with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

The AsciiDoc source of the demo presentation can be found in _src/docs/asciidoc/slides.adoc_.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML slides by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-slides/slides.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file containing the reveal.js presentation deck.

== Remarks

In order to generate the diagrams, GraphVIS needs to be installed locally. Get it from: http://www.graphviz.org/

The template is adjusted to use the codecentric font Panton, so be sure to have that installed on your presentation machine.
Any css adjustments can go to "src/main/theme/cc.css" as this is automatically embedded into the themes directory.
